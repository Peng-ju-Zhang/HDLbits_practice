## HDLbits 介绍
https://hdlbits.01xz.net/  
HDLBits is a collection of small circuit design exercises for practicing digital hardware design using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). 
Earlier problems follow a tutorial style, while later problems will increasingly challenge your circuit design skills.
Each problem requires you to design a small circuit in Verilog. 
HDLBits gives you immediate feedback on the circuit module you submit. 
Your circuit is checked for correctness by simulating with a set of test vectors and comparing it to our reference solution.
